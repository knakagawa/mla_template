# mla_template

A template / workflow for writing nice mla-formatted papers in markdown / latex.

This relies on your having the mla.bbx, mla.cbx files from
[https://github.com/knakagawa/biblatex-mla](https://github.com/knakagawa/biblatex-mla)
in this directory
~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/biblatex-mla/

The easiest way to do this is probably to copy the above repo into your latex directory

TODO(kei): make this more in depth so as to be useful to folks
